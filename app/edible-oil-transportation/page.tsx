            Dedicated means these ten tankers are not scheduled onto anything
            else. They do not take a chemical load on the return leg, they do
            not carry molasses when the sugar season is busy, and they are not
            borrowed for by-product when capacity is tight. A stainless steel
            tanker that carried a solvent last week is not a food-grade tanker,
            whatever it is washed with.

            That is a commercial decision rather than a technical one. Keeping
            ten units on a single cargo type costs utilisation — an empty return
            leg is an empty return leg. It is the only way to say that the tank
            your cooking oil travels in has never held anything but cooking oil,
            and mean it.

            Alongside spot loads we contract capacity annually. You get an agreed
            number of vehicles held against your volume, at a rate fixed for the
            term, with the same weighing procedure and the same tracking
            arrangement on every run.

          <p className="mt-5 text-mist" data-lift>
            Beyond the 49 vehicles we own, a further 40 run for us on annual
            contract and around 10 common carriers are available when a peak
            needs covering. For a refinery or a packer with a predictable monthly
            draw, contracting is usually the cheaper of the two arrangements and
            removes the scramble for tankers when everyone needs them at once.
