            Every vehicle in the fleet is HTV class, and the drivers who operate
            them hold HTV licences. That is the category Pakistani regulators and
            buyers actually use, and it is worth stating plainly rather than
            writing around: a carrier running lighter vehicles on heavy work is a
            problem that surfaces at a weighbridge or a checkpoint, not in a
            quotation.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 text-mist" data-lift>
            The distinction matters most on long motorway runs with a full tank,

              We contract four independent tracking providers rather than one.
              A single provider is a single point of failure, and in this market
              coverage varies by route and by network — four overlapping
              services means a vehicle does not go quiet because one of them has
              a bad day.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5 max-w-[58ch] text-mist" data-lift>
              Alongside the hardware, an in-house tracking department contacts
              every driver four times a day for the duration of a run. That is a
              person asking where the vehicle is and what it is doing, which is
              the part that catches a problem a map does not show.
