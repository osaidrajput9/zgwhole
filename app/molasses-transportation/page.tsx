          specification. Supply is concentrated into the crushing season, and so
          is everybody&rsquo;s demand for tankers. How a carrier handles that

            Molasses travels in mild steel tankers across the 10, 18 and 22

            The ten stainless steel tankers are not part of this fleet and never

            else, which is only a meaningful claim if it holds in the weeks when
            every other tanker is committed. By-product runs on separate
            vehicles again, kept apart from anything food-grade.

              A dense, slow-pumping cargo discharged into someone else&rsquo;s
              tank is exactly the situation where a shortfall is hard to prove
              afterwards. The procedure is the same one we run on every
              consignment, whatever is in the tank.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5 max-w-[58ch] text-mist" data-lift>
              The tanker is weighed at the loading point and the reading recorded
              against the consignment. Four independent tracking providers cover
              the fleet and our own tracking department contacts the driver four
              times a day. It is weighed again at the discharge weighbridge, and
              you get both figures.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5 max-w-[58ch] text-mist" data-lift>
              That is a measurement taken twice, not an assurance. It is also
              why a slow discharge is a scheduling problem rather than a
              commercial one: the number at the far end is the number that
              settles it.

            For a seasonal cargo, contracting is the arrangement that does the
            most work. You get an agreed number of vehicles held against your
            volume for the term, at a rate fixed in advance, rather than
            negotiating in the weeks when every mill in the country wants the
            same tankers.

            Beyond the 49 vehicles we own, a further 40 run for us on annual
            contract and around 10 common carriers are available when a peak
            needs covering. The same weighing procedure and the same tracking
            arrangement apply on contracted runs as on spot loads.
